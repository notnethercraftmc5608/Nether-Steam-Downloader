## 🔒 Why Use Nether Steam Downloader?

Steam’s Family Sharing and account-sharing features make it easy to access games, but doing so on public accounts can expose your IP address and leave your system vulnerable to unauthorized remote access. **Nether Steam Downloader** solves this by:

- Using **residential proxies** to securely verify game ownership and account access.
- Running a **sandboxed Steam client** that blocks all non-essential requests.
- Operating Steam in **offline mode** to prevent remote play vulnerabilities.

With Nether Steam Downloader, you can demo games and download mods hassle-free, all while staying secure.

## 🕷️ How It Works

2. **Fetch**: NetherSpider uses residential proxies to retrieve a verified public Steam account.
